### tl;dr

I maintain this website to collect photos, stories, and whatever else I end up deciding belongs here - for myself and others to enjoy!

### the longer version

When I quit my job as a software engineer, I wondered whether I would miss coding at all. Two days later, I was falling asleep at my keyboard at 2am with a hundred tabs open wondering how jekyll actually works as I published the first version of this website. I guess I had my answer! 

I plan on using this space to express myself in ways I am more comfortable with - taking photos and writing code - as well as in ways that I am less comfortable with - primarily writing. Why? Because it's fun! And if at some point it's not fun you best believe the digital dust will start to settle in.

Anyway, I'm happy you're here - even if it's the only time you ever will be! While I've got you here, feel free to have a look around, leave a comment if you feel like, whatever you're feeling just do your thing!
