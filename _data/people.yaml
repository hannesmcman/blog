    Johannes (Hannes) is the guinea pig first born of Rolf and Rose. He spent his childhood
    in Minneapolis, Minnesota and has since been spending his early adulthood gradually turning into his parents.
    He attended St. Olaf College in Northfield, just like Rolf, where he majored in Math
    (Rolf's major? Yep!) and Computer Science (ooh that's new!). After graduating in 2019 he moved
    to Seattle, Washington (like Rose in her twenties) to work as a Software Engineer (okay Rose wasn't 
    a Software Engineer) at Amazon. After three years at Amazon, he realized he had strayed a little
    too far from his parents' trajectories and was due for a course correct. So he quit his job and 
    applied to work at Holden Village (a lutheran retreat center in the North Cascades) for a year, 
    just like, you guessed it, Rolf did in his twenties! Although this is certainly a big step in the 
    main storyline, he decided he also had some time to indulge in a side quest or two. First up, a
    six week trip to Nepal with two of his best friends, Bidit and Ganesh. Stay tuned for updates from
    this and any other potential side quests, and perhaps even a few from the main storyline as he 
    returns to Washington and heads up to Holden, like his father before him.
