After first waking up at 2:30am and spending an hour obsessively setting up a website to share the photos I've been taking lately ([shameless plug](https://portfolio.hanboy612.com/)), I slept in and woke up in our room at Punam and Ishwar's hotel in Dhading around 8am or so. I stepped out on the balcony for a few minutes and breathed in the fresh morning air of Dhading.

Breakfast was waiting for us downstairs in the hotel's dining room - an omelette, breakfast sausage, bread with butter and jam, and coffee. Then Ganesh and I headed out to go for a walk around Dhading. We wandered down the main street for a couple blocks before taking a right up a side street leading up a hill. We passed by a shop that was playing a familiar tune: "Phul Butte Sari", which is the first Nepali song that I ever learned. Bidit showed it to me a couple years ago. I still don't know all the words, but I was pleased to know I still have the chorus and bridge down. 

We continued our ascent up the road until we came to what appeared to be a dead end. We were about to turn around when we saw an uncle chilling by the gate at the end of the road, who said "this is the way" and pointed us inside the gate. I wasn't anticipating running into a Mandalorian on our little walk around Dhading, but it was a pleasant surprise! We followed "the way" until we got back to a paved road, which we followed for a bit until we were a little out of town and were surrounded by terraced rice fields on both sides. This was the first time I'd ever seen terraced fields before and I was blown away by how beautiful they are.

We left the main road in favor of following a small dirt path that led into the rice fields, so we could get a closer look. We came across an auntie at a fork in the path who told us to take the right side, as there were smelly pigs to the left. We weren't in a big pig smelling mood, although small pigs would've been alright I suppose. Needless to say, we took her advice and headed to the right. The path we were on ended up taking us on a loop in between the rice fields, along a stream, and back around to the road. 

We took the road back to the hotel and were treated to another delicious round of dal bhat prepared by Punam. After lunch Ganesh headed out to see some relatives and I stayed back at the hotel to read a bit and nap. He's planning on documenting his time in Dhading in a post of his own - which I'll add here once he's had a chance to write it down - stay tuned! While he was gone I also tried on Ishwar's daura suruwal (a traditional male dress of Nepal) to see if it would fit me so I could wear it at the wedding we would be attending in a few days, at the groom's request. Unfortunately it was too short and tight in the legs, but I still would have a chance to try on Ganesh's other brother-in-law's daura suruwal when we got to Chitwan. 

Ganesh returned from his trip to the relatives and woke me up from my nap in the best possible way: "Momos?". We headed down to the hotel's dining room again and I had my first plate of momos in Nepal.

The keema (filling) was chicken and the achar was fire, even if it could've been spicier. Overall very mitho cha. Apparently the momos were just a snack and we would have dinner later, but after finishing one plate of momos I knew that'd have to be my last meal of the day - apparently my stomach still has some growing to do before I can fit four meals in. 

After momos Ishwar offered to take us for a drive around town in his truck. It was around 6 o'clock and the streets of Dhading were coming to life as the temperature cooled off, kids finished their homework and the adults wrapped up their workdays. The drive made clear just how small a town Dhading is, as Ishwar stopped a half dozen times along the drive to have short conversations with friends and family members. I found this out later, but one of the stops he made was to ask a friend of his if he could hire him to drive Ganesh and I to Chitwan the next morning - which indeed ended up working out. We also stopped along the drive at a scenic overlook of the Thopal Khola river as it emerged from the rolling hills in the distance to flow in between the rice fields below.

When we returned from the drive we set out to a local clothing shop to try to find something to wear for the first day of the wedding. We were asked to wear something yellow and Ganesh had spotted a couple yellow kurtha (another traditional male dress, but this one is more common in India) in this shop earlier in the day - we just needed to try them on. We got super lucky as she had the kurtha Ganesh had seen earlier in two sizes, which fit each of us perfectly. The shopkeeper/ artist responsible for the creations was very friendly and asked if she could take a video of us for her TikTok. The result:

<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@pari.boutique_dhading123/video/7146564098384268570" data-video-id="7146564098384268570" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;" > <section> <a target="_blank" title="@pari.boutique_dhading123" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pari.boutique_dhading123?refer=embed">@pari.boutique_dhading123</a> <p></p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Ambika shrestha" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7146564127573429019?refer=embed">♬ original sound - Ambika shrestha</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script>

Ganesh talked to her for a bit while a couple final touches were put on our kurthas and we found out that she actually exports her work to several stores in the U.S., where each piece fetches a much higher price than the 3250 Rs. ($26 USD) that we paid for each kurtha. We also got to see her cut the material for a new dress, for which the only tool she used was a pair of scissors and eyeballed all measurements, without using anything for a reference. She seamed* to know what she was doing. 

I crashed when we got back from the clothing shop, but Ganesh stayed up with Punam and somehow managed to fit yet another meal in his belly. An impressive feat, I must say. We woke up early the next morning to set out for Chitwan and hopefully avoid any traffic. We said goodbye to Punam, Ishwar and the kids - all of whom we will see again (Ganesh for Dashain and myself during Tihar) and managed to grab a picture of the fam before we hit the road.
