We made it! On the plane at least. Ganesh and I are flying over not-so-Greenland at the moment, according to the flight map. I'm not sure if it's the fact that the flight map is in Arabic, or the fact that we popped a couple edibles before going through security, but I can't tell how high we are! Okay full disclosure we actually forgot the edibles, but still. We're up here.

My day didn't start at 30,000 feet. I woke up very close to sea level. It was my last morning waking up in my bedroom a.k.a. Alex's home office in Ballard, concluding my 10-day stay at the *House of the Rising Son - Li-ders in Accomodations* (owned and operated by my friends Alex Son and Li Downs). I met Alex and Li early in our time together at St. Olaf, before they were a couple, became parents to Tula (esteemed member of my top three list of best golden doodles I have ever met, along with my aunt and uncle's doodles Orzo and Dakota), and moved to Seattle to join our little midwest/Ole contingent. 

Alex and Li spent a year in Fremont before moving to their current place in Ballard a few months ago, at which point the rest of our Seattle-Olaf friend group had to grapple with the fact that we might never see them again! Our worry stemmed from a common superstition in Seattle that once you move to Ballard you will never be seen or heard from again, since it is so far away from most other neighborhoods. Ballard also has a somewhat self-sufficient vibe to it, which probably factors into the rumor as well. So when I was looking for places to crash in between my lease ending on September 1st and our flight today, September 20th, I decided I would face the superstition head on and move in with Alex and Li for a bit! They graciously accepted my proposition and what followed was an absolutely wonderful stretch of days, during which we interacted with exactly zero other humans besides ourselves! I kid - we saw a couple other people.

Staying with Alex and Li was an absolute dream. I felt right at home in my little room without ever feeling like I was a burden or imposing one bit. Not only that, but I got to spend so much time just hanging out with Alexa and Li. We watched a couple episodes of the new Game of Thrones show, watched Tula go crazy at the site of Alex's toy drone, hit the climbing gym a couple times, grilled at Golden Gardens with a little group, succumbed to the influence of dairy at the famous Ballard farmer's market, grabbed drinks at their favorite bar down the street (I bet you can't guess the name....wait for ittt....Olaf's!), and many other moments in between. 

I also got so much Tula time in!! I hadn't spend so much time with Tula since I looked after her a few months ago when Alex and Li were out of town - I missed her crazy puppy energy and how she sits down on your clothes when your folding them. I got her a Yak's milk treat based on a recommendation from the employee at Mud Bay and I was happy to see she seemed quite taken with it (and didn't even get the shits!). I am so grateful to Alex and Li for inviting me into their home and making me feel like part of their little family for a few days.

Although I'm sure Tula is thinking about nothing more than food or the possibility of treats in this picture, I like to think she misses me. I will miss her. Until November, Tula. 

By 10:30am, I was 99% packed and it was time to head to Lynnwood to drop off my car and a few more boxes of my stuff at Mary Grace's house! Mary Grace is one of my mom's best friends and in the short time that I have known her has treated me as one of her own kids. She and her husband Jay have been so generous to allow me to store all of my stuff at their house while I am traveling. Every time I show up with a couple more boxes, Mary Grace is outside helping me unload things, even if she was definitely in the middle of something else. She is a keeper and I am so glad my mom found her and connected us. I am looking forward to many more kick backs on their beautiful back porch in the near future!

I wasn't able to get my life into as few boxes as I had hoped, but it's a start! After dropping off the rest of my stuff and my car Byplav at Mary Grace's Alex dropped me at Ganesh's place. Then Ganesh and I hopped on the light rail and headed to Seatac (the airport)!

We flew through security (me a little bit faster thanks to Pre-check - shout out day one family friend Barb for telling me to get Global Entry ten years ago) and then made our way to one of the airport lounges that I have access to thanks to my fancy travel credit card that I have to remember to cancel now that I have no salary. We each had ourselves a little free cocktail and some gumbo soup and I made a note to make sure I fly with my dad before I lose access to these lounges because I think he'd get a kick out of it. 

After about an hour in the lounge we headed to our gate and boarded our fourteen hour Qatar Airways flight to Doha. We will have a one and a half hour layover in Doha before continuing on to Kathmandu and honestly I don't even know how long that flight is! Definitely shorter though.

It feels pretty good to have gotten this far without having forgotten anything *too* important, knock on woo- wait, that won't work. After a quick look around its clear that Qatar Airways didn't send it with the wood grain. Where does that oil money go? They're definitely not pouring their money into security either. Ganesh and I had the most low-key security screening on the jetbridge - it was so chill we had to laugh. Two swipes with a wand that was clearly not turned on, a gentle shake of each of our carry-on bags, and we were sent on our merry way. Definitely better than the alternative, so you won't hear us complaining!

The checking agent was kind enought to put Ganesh and I next to each other for both flights, so I get to put my Gin and Tonic on his tray table to make room for my laptop as I write just now. We also met the third passenger in our row, an exceedingly kind woman named Nadifa who is traveling home to Oman. We struck up a conversation over the contents of the airline food, which did not meet her exceptionally healthy food standards. We were curious how long she has been eating so healthy (no meat, only fish, no gluten, meals only twice a day, etc) and she asked us to guess her age. I gave the classic low-ball at 30, followed by a more serious guess of 58, since she had told us she has five kids and the youngest is 30. Turns out she is 64 and damn she looks good! Just another gentle push from the universe to become a vegan - maybe someday, universe. But not today.

The conversation about healthy food sparked a line of inquiry about what kind of food Oman has to offer. Nadifa spoke of an abundance of amazing seafood from the Red Sea, of the homeade juice that she makes from a whole host of healthy fruits/vegetables, and of a variety of injera in Oman that is apparently lighter than the Ethiopian staple that bears the same name. Ganesh and I know virtually nothing about Oman, so we spent most of the time listening and asking questions. Nadifa is an incredibly worldly person, speaking upwards of four lanugages: Arabic, Somali, English, Spanish, and I think a couple more! Her children are scattered around the world in places like Sweden, Germany, Seattle, London and the Netherlands and include among them a brain surgeon, an engineer and a fashion designer. Her children speak even more languages than her! She is clearly very proud of her children and how they turned out and man does she have every reason to be. I'm over here barely being able to speak English and her kids are speaking upwards of five languages each! Well, hopefully I can turn these feelings of inadequacy into some more positive motivation to practice my Spanish and make steps towards fluency. Nadifa was incredibly bullish on Oman as a place to both live and visit, and I must say she has us convinced that we are due for a trip. Especially when she offered that we could stay at one of her homes there if we ever made the trip. I told her she should be careful what she offers, and she responded by putting her number in our phones. I guess a trip to Oman might have to be in the cards.

As we were descending in Doha we found out that Nadifa is even making it to the world cup this year! She even has tickets to the finals! We asked her how she's making the kind of money to pay for World Cup finals tickets and she let us know that she's a teacher in Oman, where the teachers are treated and paid similarly to the way doctors are in the States. That information was a pleasant surprise. I still know very little about Oman as a whole, but that's dope. Ganesh and I will have to remember to text her during the world cup so we can see some pictures of her and her family at the games.

I'll wrap this post up by mentioning that I am wearing my new favorite Ray Troll shirt that my friend Hafiza got for me on her recent trip to Alaska. She scored major friend points with this one. I'm currently up to 3 compliments on the day and it is going straight to my head. Although I'm realizing I haven't listened to enough Pink Floyd so I've got some homework to do.
