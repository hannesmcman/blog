After a very relaxing stay in Dhading, we hit the road again to travel south to Narayangarh, which is in in the Chitwan district and is where Ganesh's other sister Pabitra lives with her husband Ganendra and their three kids Pragya, Praju and Pragyan (twins). Ishwar was kind enough to find a driver to take us in his pickup truck on the two and half hour drive from Dhading to Narayangarh and so after a quick breakfast we hit the road with Shyam at the wheel. We found out that Shyam had spent 18 years driving a semi-truck in Qatar, where he claims to have learned Arabic on his own in three months, so rest-assured we were in good hands. 

The drive south was as stunning as the drive into Dhading had been, and it was even better from the comfort of a truck. We started the ride along the Thopal Khola river surrounded by densely forested rolling hills (mountains by my midwestern standards), which we eventually left behind in favor of the Trishuli River and the flatlands of the Terai. It rained a bit on our way and both rivers we rode along were churning fast, with the light brown color of monsoon season. 

We ran into a bit of traffic on the way, but it was nothing compared to our bus ride. It was not long before we found ourselves rolling into Chitwan, and then into the center of Narayangarh. We parked outside Pabitra's house and Ganesh gave Pabitra the suprise call to come let us in.

We brought our bags up and got to meet Pabitra's kids. Pragya, the oldest, is seven years old and liked to pretend we didn't exist for the first day we were there. She's a sass queen, but after messing with her every once and a while we eventually got her to engage with us. Praju and Pragyan are two-year-old twins and it was Ganesh's first time meeting them in person! They are polar opposites. Praju is the definition of a happy baby, instantly taking to whoever picks her up, especially if they give her a couple spins and perhaps a little toss in the air. Pragyan was the shy one - never straying far from his mom and constantly giving that "who tf are you?" look to anyone else.

We had a low-key afternoon chilling with the kids and eating some fire dal bhat that Pabitra made, with the spiciest achar of the trip so far. Ganendra came home from work later in the afternoon. He had a big smile on his face the moment we first saw him and there hasn't been a moment since that I haven't seen him smiling.

Some time later, Ganesh's cousin Saurav came over. He is a dentist in Narayangarh who has a very calm, lighthearted air about him. We left with him to go for a walk around Narayangarh and stopped to see an auntie and uncle of Ganesh's on the way back. We stopped in their storefront and had some coffee while Ganesh endured some ridicule for his bleached hair followed by the "why aren't you married yet?" question and was reminded that when he does marry he better marry a Nepali girl. He also had to explain who was the random American with him, which has become somewhat of a pattern by this point. I smiled and nodded and threw in a couple of the few Nepali phrases I've got down at this point: "Vetera khusi lagyo" (nice to meet you) and "Pheri Bhetaula" (see you soon). After the stop at the relative's place we headed back to Pabitra's as Saurav went to his home to grab his wife Grishma and their two scooters to come pick us up to go out for jol momo (Nepali dumplings with brothy soup).

Saurav and Grishma arrived to pick us up on their two scooters. They let us ride one and they took the other, Ganesh driving and me on the back. We followed Saurav and Grishma for a 15 minute trip through the streets of Narayangarh to the momo place. My trust in Ganesh's scooter driving skills was not misplaced, he has not lost his touch.

Once we got to the restaurant we asked for buffalo momo (which I haven't had yet), but they were out so we went with chicken jol momo and choila (charred buffalo meat marinated after its cooked), paired with a Gorkha Beer.

On the way home we stopped in at another of Saurav and Ganesh's relative's places, where we met Ganesh's cousin Sudesh. After chatting for a bit at their place Sudesh offered to drive us to a resort he knows to get a drink. We hopped in his truck and ended up in a Gazebo right next to the storng monsson current of the Trishuli. I started to get pretty sleepy around 10pm, a shocker I know, so after one beer we headed back home for the night. But while we were talking Sudeshtold us of a short but steep hike right outside Narayangarh with a temple at the top where we could get a 360 degree view of the city and surrounding area. He offered to pick us up at 5:30 the next morning to hike it and we said "damn that's early but we're down." To bed!

My body naturally woke me up at 4:30 - still jetlagged a bit - and Sudesh showed up right around 5:30 to pick us up. The hike is a steady climb up 2,200 steps over 1,089 feet of elevation gain that leads to the Maula Kalika temple at the top. The temple is dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kalika (or Kali), who is the goddess of War, Anger, Time, Change, Creation, Destruction and Power. Seems kind of OP to me, but we took Tika at the top to make sure we wouldn't be on her bad side just in case. Overall the hike up was a fantastic way to start the day. It was early enough so the heat was bearable, but we still worked up quite a sweat well before we reached the top. At the top we had an excellent 365-degree view of Narayangarh, just as Sudesh had promised.

Sudesh was clearly a regular at Maula Kalika - he said what's up to what had to have been more than a dozen uncles on the way up and down. He even pointed out a couple mirrors mounted at the temple that he had installed there one morning for fun, each complete with the message "These mirrors are provided by the generosity of Sudesh Shrestha." He's a clown. We chilled at the top for about 15 minutes before heading back down.

Before heading home we stopped at a smoothie shop that is owned by one of Sudesh's friends to get avocado smoothies. The avocado smoothies themselves were replete with dairy, as I expected, so I steered* clear and ordered a watermelon juice and a coffee instead. I did have a taste of Ganesh's avocado smoothie just to see what I was missing and let me tell ya they made the most of that dairy. It was udderly* delectable. The spot was also the most westernized place we'd been so far - white walls on the inside, glass countertops, large circular windows - it honestly reminded me a bit of the Izze's ice cream location right by the Guthrie in Minneapolis.

After Sudesh dropped us back at home it started to rain. The rain was accompanied by consistent claps of thunder, the likes of which are extremely rare in Seattle. I spent a while on the upper floor of the house sitting in a hammock listening to the thunder and appreciating the cooler temperatures brought on by the rain. We still had to travel to Chitwan National Park, where we would be attending Ganesh's friend Sohil's wedding, and since it seemed the rain would stick around for a while Ganendra offered to give us a ride to the wedding venue in his truck. But before we set off we stopped at a local barbershop so that Ganesh and I could each get a fresh shave before the wedding - to achieve maximum handsomeness. That was a relaxing experience - a close shave plus a face wash and a facial massage in a room with A/C...all for 300 Rs. ($2.50 USD): 10/10 would recommend.

After our shave we set off with Ganendra headed for the Park Safari Resort in Chitwan National Park. The rain meant there was quite a bit of traffic so the 20 minute trip turned into about an hour, but we rolled up to the hotel just in time for dinner. We said goodbye to Ganendra - we'd see him again soon - and checked into our room. 

....on the next episode....

A three-day wedding extravaganza that was by far the boujeest wedding I've ever attended - and may never be beat in my lifetime!
