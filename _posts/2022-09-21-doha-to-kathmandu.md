When we landed in Doha we had no idea what time it was and it wasn't until we got off the plane that we checked. By that point it was 18:00 and we realized our flight to Kathmandu started boarding at 17:45.

That realization put a spring in our step and we were soon speed walking through the massive, brand-spanking new airport that was built to host the crowds that will soon descend upon it for the 2022 FIFA Men's World Cup. We hustled down a seemingly endless hallway in search of a sign for the B gates and were walking for a solid 15 minutes before we found what we were looking for: <-- B Transfers. So we took the left and walked a little ways until we came upon a concerning sight: very long lines. We were going to have to go through security again and our flight was scheduled to depart in less than half an hour.

With nothing to do but fall in line, that's what we did. However, we quickly determined the line was not moving fast enough for us to make our flight, so we asked the person in front of us what time their flight boards: 18:45 - they had nothing to worry about. We flashed our boarding passes with our 17:45 boarding time and asked if we could cut ahead in line and they waved us on. We successfully did this all the way to the front of the line - which had to have saved us at least 15 minutes. And we weren't the only ones! I didn't realize at the time but Ganesh told me later that the woman who was behind us in line hitched a ride. She pretended to be with us as we passed by everyone until we got through security, at which point she departed with a quick "thanks!" and headed off to a different gate. A veteran move. 

Once we made it to the front of the line, there was only one hitch going through security, which requires a little context. I am traveling with two 35mm film cameras (a Contaflex Zeiss Ikon IV and a Canon AE-1) and four rolls of undeveloped film to use on the trip. For those who don't know, undeveloped film cannot go through X-Rays without being damaged, so when flying with film you have to ask for the film cannisters and any cameras with an active roll in them to be hand-checked by one of the agents. I have never had an issue getting a hand-check for film cannisters or a loaded camera when flying domestically in the U.S. and from the research I had done it seemed like it shouldn't be a problem in most airports around the world, as long as you can communicate why a hand-check is necessary in whatever language the security agents speak. I had Google Translate up and ready with a short explanation from English -> Arabic, which didn't end up being necessary as the security agents all spoke English. However, when I handed the film cannisters and the loaded Contaflex to the agent he explained that while they would hand-check the cannisters, they would not do so for the camera. Damn. An explanation/exception was not forthcoming, and we were already running late, so I gave up and watched as the roll of Ilford HP5 sitting inside the Contaflex rode the conveyor belt to its fate. Of course I won't know the damage until I get that roll developed, but I'm actually pretty curious to see how bad it actually is, or if it leaves a cool effect that just adds another layer to the story of each photo on the roll. Something to look forward to!

Back to the gate race. By the time we made it through security it was 18:30, which gave us 15 minutes until our flight's scheduled departure. This was the point at which we left the fastwalking behind and broke into an all-out sprint to the finish line.

Five minutes later we arrived, panting and sweating with glasses fogged by deep breaths trapped in a mask to an open gate. We weren't even the last ones to board, that place was reserved for Gucci, the guy who ended up sitting next to us. A truck driver originally from Delhi but living in Canada, Gucci said he flees to Nepal every year once the snow comes to Toronto and doesn't return until it is all safely melted. He seemd like a chill guy, he was definitely not trying to chill in the Toronto winter.

Ganesh and I spent most of the four hour flight watching In the Heights, which hit exactly as I hoped it would. Hopefully Gucci didn't read into it when he tapped me on the shoulder to get to the bathroom and I turned to him, eyes brimming with tears, and nodded before getting up to let him out. I also took a little nap.

Finally, at 2:30 local time we landed in Kathmandu.

We took the shortest bus ride ever to the gate and proceeded to customs/immigration so I could get my visa on arrival. The whole immmigration process went pretty smoothly and soon we were on the other side - on the lookout for SIM cards and a taxi. Here's where we encountered the next hiccup on our journey so far, as all of the SIM card storefronts were closed and we weren't able to access the wifi without a Nepali phone number. This was a problem because we didn't yet have the address for the place we were staying that night. Ganesh's cousin Binita and her husband Nirmal were generous enough to offer a place for us to stay at Nirmal's childhood home, which was very close to the airport, but Binita had planned to send the address to Ganesh while we were in the air, so until we got wifi we didn't know where to go. Eventually we found a spot in the airport past baggage claim where there was a different wifi network that we could join without a Nepali phone number and I was able to get my phone to connect to it - but Ganesh's phone still wasn't able to connect for some reason (we later realized it was because he had his VPN enabled - which might trigger a memory for anyone from our online Catan squad). Since I was the only one with wifi, I looked up Binita on facebook and sent her a message request - hoping she would see it. 

Thankfully, Binita had our backs and responded to my message in only a couple minutes. Once we had the address we headed outside to catch a taxi. We were anticipating higher rates as long as I was with Ganesh and we were not wrong about that! Ganesh laughed off the first couple offers before finally getting a reasonable price. A couple random guys grabbed the handles of our bags as we walked and "helped" us load them into the taxi, which we knew would cost us a "tip". Once we forked over the equivalent of a couple bucks we were off.

I sat in the front and directed our driver based off google maps on my phone, since I had downloaded offline maps for Kathmandu when we had wifi. Ten minutes later, we met Binita and Nirmal at the house, who were kind enough (and perhaps jetlagged enough themselves, having flown in only the day before) to have stayed up to greet us. They were super fun to meet, but will have to wait until the next post, as we are already cutting into the early hours of September 22nd. The 22nd turned out to be eventful enough itself to warrant its own post - stay tuned!
