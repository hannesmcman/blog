Binita (Ganesh's cousin) and Nirmal (her husband) greeted us at Nirmal's childhood home in Kathmandu at about 3am. We thought about trying to get a couple of hours rest, but decided that if we tried to sleep we would end up crashing and being jetlagged for the next couple of days. So we decided to power through and try our best to stay awake for the rest of the day. We had the blissful opportunity to wash our feet and faces and Binita kindly offered to bring us tea and biscuits, which was an easy yes. We spent the rest of the early hours of the morning chatting with Binita and Nirmal, who ended up staying up with us the whole night. They had recently arrived in Kathmandu themselves from Jackson, Mississippi and are also spending most, if not all of the month of October in Nepal for festival season. We found out that they will also be spending a good chunk of their time in Pokhara, so we'll get to see more of each other soon. In fact, when we mentioned that we are planning on doing the Mardi Himal trek while we are in Pokhara they told us that Mardi was on their short-list and asked which days we were going. We gave them the dates and let them know that they would be more than welcome to join us if it works out! Binita and Nirmal were so kind and chill - I hope they're able to join us.

As night turned into morning, we started to look ahead to the day's journey - the final leg of our travels before we'd have a chance to sleep in a bed and chill for a bit. We were headed to Dhading, which is about a three hours drive from Kathmandu, to stay with Ganesh's sister Punam and her husband Ishwar and their three kids Ipsita, Nandita, and Ivan. It would be the first in a series of surprises for Ganesh's family members, none of whom knew that he was coming home so soon! He had left his family under the impression that we wouldn't be arriving until Tihar (the Hindu festival at the end of October). Somehow he has managed to preserve the secret this long, which is pretty impressive. I was definitely looking forward to seeing the look on the faces of his sister and her family when we showed up out of nowhere in Dhading that afternoon. 

But before we could set out for Dhading we still had a couple of things left to do. First, get ourselves two Nepali SIM cards and second, meet up with Bidit's cousin Arpan to give him a high-powered lenovo laptop that we had brought for him in our luggage. The same laptop is ~~$200~~ $800 more expensive in Nepal than in the states, so Bidit had it shipped to us so we could bring it and #savedatmoney. Arpan had his final exams that day, so he swung by at 7am before his exams to grab the laptop and drop off some cash for us to use for the next several days. He also ended up having an extra Ncell SIM card that he was kind enough to give to me, which was clutch after the Ncell airport location had been unexpectedly closed. Arpan arrived on his motorbike right on time and we got to chat for a few minutes before he had to head out - just long enough to learn that he was planning on using the laptop for video editing with his brother, which is dope. We snapped a quick selfie to send to Bidit and said peace to Arpan for now - we'll see him later in Pokhara and he'll join us for the Mardi trek as well.

Once we said goodbye to Arpan it was time to make moves to get to Dhading. We would be taking a taxi to the bus stop where we could catch a bus to Dhading and we wanted to get an early start to try to avoid any possible traffic to hopefully get to Dhading before the hours of peak heat in the late afternoon. Ganesh and Binita walked around the corner to get the Nepali price for a taxi, which didn't take long at all. We said ttfn (ta ta for now) to Binita and Nirmal, hopped in the taxi and our journey to Dhading began!

The fit in the taxi was a little tight, but it only took about half an hour to get to the bus stop. The cab ride was my first chance to see Kathmandu, Nepal's most populous city, in the daylight. The streets were bustling with motorbikes, buses, trucks and cars, in roughly that order. For the sheer amount of vehicles on the road, with hardly a traffic sign in sight, the day's traffic took the shape of a loosely controlled chaos. Each driver was on their own quest as they weaved through the steady stream of vehicles, yet there was a clear cooperation among everyone on the road to keep each other safe.

We rolled up to the bus stop and it didn't take long to find the bus headed to Dhading. We loaded ourselves and our bags in and haggled a bit with the driver about whether we should have to pay for four seats or two since our bags were taking up two seats on their own. We ended up paying for four seats, which as we would soon find out was an excellent move. The first hour of the ride went by smoothly as our bus ascended into the densley forested hills surrounding Kathmandu. The road was paved pretty well, with the occasional gravel patch due to some construction project or erosion from the monsoon season. It was just wide enough for two buses to pass each other side by side, pressed up against the hill with nothing but sheer drop-off on the other side. But the view past the drop-off was absolutely gorgeous. Rolling hills covered in dense woods folding over one another into the distance.

Anyone who knows me well enough knows that I physically cannot resist a good car nap and the rhythm of the bus flying over the small bumps in the road paired with the breeze from the open window was enough to put me right to sleep.

I woke up with a start when the bus came abruptly to a halt at the direction of the traffic police. After some back and forth between our driver and the police about what was going on, we pulled off to the side of the road and word trickled back that there had been an accident up the road and an ensuing commotion had caused the road ahead to be completely blocked. The full story was incredibly sad. Earlier in the morning a bus had struck and killed a nine year old boy who was crossing the street with his sister in a crosswalk. The bystanders who saw what happened swarmed the bus and a large group of people quickly formed. The driver was pulled from the vehicle and the townspeople broke his legs as they set fire to the bus. The torched bus was left in the middle of the road to send a message to the rest of the bus drivers who had to drive by it that day on their routes. Understandably, it took a while before traffic was moving again. 

We didn't know it at the time, but we would be sitting still with that bus for the next three hours as we entered the hours of peak heat clocking in at around ninety degrees fahrenheit. When we first stopped, thinking we'd only be there for several minutes at most, we grabbed some suuuper healthy snacks to tide us over (dried noodles and chips) and went to stand in the shade under a nearby storefront to wait it out.

Minutes ticked by, followed by hours, as the line of buses and cars grew longer and longer. About two hours in, some of the buses decided to turn around and head back to Kathmandu, leaving their passengers to find their own way on. Thankfully for us, our driver said that he would wait it out and wouldn't turn back. News of his commitment must have spread quickly because when we came back to the bus after another snack run, several of the passengers from the buses that turned back had hopped on our bus so that all the seats (including our own) and the entire aisle were now filled. We got back just in time to reclaim our seats, with some help from the driver - who was a G - and from that point on decided that we'd leave at least one person in the seats at all times. We were very thankful that we'd purchased the extra seats for our luggage as well, otherwise we'd probably have ended up with our bags on our laps.

Right around the three hour mark of our wait the police started to let vehicles through. We were on the road again, but progress was very slow, as the backlog of vehicles on both side of the blockage had grown quite large. It was stop and go until we got to the site of the accident and passed by the burnt out shell of the bus that had been at the center of the day's tragedy. We made it the rest of the way to Dhading without any major traffic and arrived outside Punam and Ishwar's place at about 4pm, concluding our seven hour adventure from Kathmandu to Dhading. 

Punam was there to welcome us, along with Ivan, her youngest. Ganesh had planned to surprise her, but she already knew we were coming becuase we had called her earlier from the traffic jam in search of some information and a backup plan in case our bus turned around. I didn't know it until we arrived, but Ishwar owns and operates a hotel in Dhading, so we would be spending our time in Dhading in a free hotel room! After a couple of glorious showers we headed downstairs to the residence, where Punam showed us the rice beds in the backyard where she plants and harvests all of the rice she uses in her cooking. Then we were treated to some of that cooking with a plate of Dal Bhat (rice and dal), with chicken, eggplant, and achar.

It only took a single bite to realize that I'll be gaining at least 10 pounds on this trip. Mitho cha!

After dinner we saw Nandita and Ishwar. Nandita was extremely shy, but Punam told us she is quite the budding artist and brought us to her room to see some of her drawings. I must say, there was no motherly bias in her claim - the girl is mad talented!! Her walls were covered with her work, from drawings of anime characters to landscape paintings. It was very cool to see. Ishwar returned home after dinner and made sure we were all set for the night and he and Ganesh had a chance to catch up for a while. The plan was to have momo (Nepali street dumplings) later, which honestly didn't seem realistic based on how bloated I already was from dinner, but I could never say no to momo. I left Ganesh and Ishwar to catch up some more and headed to the room to take a nap before momo. Or so I thought. Turns out I was headed to bed - I was out cold the minute my head hit the pillow. Momos would have to wait.

> CORRECTION: Bidit texted me to let me know that the laptop we brought for Arpan is actually $800 more expensive in Nepal than in the U.S. He suggested I bring a couple laptops to sell next time and pay for my trip! Not a bad idea...
